# API reference

xpcc is a relatively large framework with many APIs and advanced concepts.
We are annotating our APIs using Doxygen and are trying to provide conceptual
design documentation on [our project blog](http://blog.xpcc.io).
However, this is a slow and difficult process, and the results are not perfect.

The most complete and most up-to-date API documentation is definitely the

- [Doxygen API reference][doxygen].

Unfortunately the generated HAL for our many devices confuses Doxygen.
We therefore chose to only include the HAL API for `ATtiny85`, the `ATmega328p`
and the `STM32F407vg` online.
The rest of the xpcc API is documented without limitations.

## Your device

We recommend that you generate the documentation for your own project locally.
To do so, simply execute our documentation command `scons doc` inside your project folder.
This will build the xpcc documentation with your specific project configuration in `build/doc/`.

If you are stuck, don't hesitate to [send us an email with your questions][mailing_list].
